# Basic Programs
1. Two friends want to find the total of their savings. Write a program to calculate the sum of two numbers.
2. Imagine you are attending a virtual event where you need to introduce yourself. Write a program that displays Good morning your name on the screen.
3. Write a program to simulate a simple ATM withdrawal.
- Take an initial balance of 5000.
- Deduct an amount (say 1200) from the balance using arithmetic and assignment operators.
- If the balance after withdrawal is less than 1000, display a warning message using an if statement.
- Use comments to explain each step.

4. Write a program to determine whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
- Use comparison operators to check the conditions.
- Use if-else-if statements to display the correct message.
- Use a unary operator (++) to increment the number and show the updated value.

5. Write a program to calculate movie ticket price based on age:
- If age < 12, ticket = ₹100.
- If age >= 12 and < 60, ticket = ₹200.
- If age >= 60, ticket = ₹120 (senior citizen discount).
- Use the ternary operator to determine the price.
- Display the price with a message.

6. Write a program to calculate the final bill for a shopping cart.
- If the total purchase is above ₹5000, apply a 20% discount.
- If the total purchase is between ₹2000 and ₹5000, apply a 10% discount.
- Otherwise, no discount.
- Use comparison operators and if-else statements.
- Use assignment operators to update the total after discount.

7. Write a program to simulate a login system.
- Assume username = "admin" and password = "1234".
- If both the username and password are correct, print "Login Successful".
- Otherwise, print "Invalid Credentials".
- Use logical operators (&&) and if-else.
